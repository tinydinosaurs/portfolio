	/* MAKEY THE RAINBOW:
	1. use inset to spread shadow inward rather than outward
	2. horizontal and vertical shadows are set to zero to keep the shadow centered.
	3. zero blur for crisp edges. if you want a softer rainbow, play with the blur value.
	4. shadows are drawn back to front, so your last shadow needs the largest spread distance, as all other shadows
	will be drawn on top of it. Thanks to HTML Goodies for box shadow help: http://www.htmlgoodies.com/html5/client/mastering-css3-box-shadows.html
