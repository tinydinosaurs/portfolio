			<h2>Exquisite Corpse</h2>
			<p>Exquisite Corpse is a single page application that I built as my final project for The Iron Yard, an intensive, full-time, 3-month coding bootcamp.</p>
			<p>The app is inspired by and borrows its name from a game played by Surrealists artists. Participants contribute, in turn, to a written work but are only shown the last few lines of text written by the previous collaborator. The name is derived from a line in one of the Surrealists' first such projects: Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau ("The exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine").</p>
			<p>The app is built using React views, Backbone models and collections, node.js postgress, and express.</p>

			<h2>Texas Education Agency</h2>
			<p>Rebuilding the Texas Education website's content architecture is among my proudest achievements.  The project was part of a ground-up web redesign.</p>
			<p>Users reported that they found our website difficult to navigate. Poor organization, outdated content, and duplicate pages were common concerns.</p>
			<p>To tackle the problem, I evaluated the websites 5,000 pages, sorting them into categories. Then, following usability best practices, I sketched out a content tree.</p>
			<p>Next, I worked with content writers to delete old and duplicate pages. The result is website navigation that, in most cases, goes no more than four levels deep.</p>
			<p>Once all the site's pages had a home, I spearheaded a project to rewrite content in plain language. I also helped create a simplified process for getting content published on the site.</p>

			<h2>Franklin Barbecue</h2>
			<p>Back when Aaron and Stacey were running their barbecue joint out of an Airstream trailer in Austin, they needed someone to help them create a web presence.</p>
			<p>I designed and built their first website using a retro look that communicated Franklin's aesthetic as well as the spirit of both Austin and Texas barbecue culture.</p>
			<p>They've since moved to a brick and mortar building and hired a web studio to rebuild and maintain their site, but if you visit, you'll see they kept many elements of my original design.</p>
